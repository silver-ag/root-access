And now I lay me down to study,<br>
and pray the Lord I won't go nutty,<br>
and if I fail to learn this junk,<br>
I pray the Lord that I won't flunk,<br>
but if I do, don't pity me at all,<br>
just lay my bones in the study hall,<br>
tell my teacher I did my best,<br>
and lay my books upon my chest.
