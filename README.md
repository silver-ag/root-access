# Root Access

yet another deliberately vulnerable webapp.

inlcudes the obligatory password in the comments and javascript login, as well as more interesting stages like a combination cookie poisoning and command injection attack.

#### installation
-get the files : `git clone https://github.com/silver-ag/root-access.git`
-copy everything (except optionally the README) to `/var/www/html`
-`apachectl start` or equivalent.
